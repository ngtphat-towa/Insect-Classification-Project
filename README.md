## Project Title: Building an Insect Detection Model Based on Images

## Introduction

This project, titled "Building an Insect Detection Model Based on Images" (Project Code: THS2023-54), aims to develop a model for detecting objects in images using the YOLOv8 model for classification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have a development environment that supports Flutter and TFLite. You will also need access to Google Colab for training the model.

### Installation

The installation process involves setting up your development environment, cloning the GitHub repository, and installing the necessary libraries and dependencies.

## Usage

The usage of this project involves several steps:

1. Researching the process of building an object detection model in images.
2. Collecting images and building a database for the insect recognition system.
3. Building an object detection model in images and training the model on Google Colab.
4. Building the application interface.
